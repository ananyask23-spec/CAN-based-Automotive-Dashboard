# CAN-based-Automotive-Dashboard
A Controller Area Network (CAN bus) is a vehicle bus standard designed to allow  Microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other in applications without a  host computer. It is a message-based protocol, designed originally for multiplex electrical  wiring within auto-mobiles, but is also used in many other contexts.
